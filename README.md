# quiz_website

This is a basic quiz website that allows local functionality of taking quizzes, keeping track of points, and even allowing the user to create their own quizzes.
This was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My favorite part of this project was figuring out how to make a useful quiz-creater page that allowed for common
functionality such as deleting questions and making sure that it doesn't affect other parts of the data.
